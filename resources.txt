               "This object gives the status of the member-switch in the VSF 
               virtual chassis. 

               unusedId (0)      - The member ID does not exist. 
               missing (1)       - An VSF virtual chassis member-switch is marked as 
                                   missing when it becomes non-responsive. A lack of 
                                   response from the switch means that either the 
                                   virtual chassis link or the virtual chassis member 
                                   has crashed. Note that it is possible to remove a 
                                   missing member from the virtual chassis. Once removed, 
                                   the missing member's configuration will be deleted 
                                   from the virtual chassis configuration file.
              provision (2)      - A member-switch that is not physically present 
                                   but whose configuration is provisioned .
              commander (3)      - The member-switch which is the commander of the
                                   VSF virtual chassis.
              standby (4)        - The member-switch which is the standby of the 
                                   VSF virtual chassis.
              member (5)         - The member-switch that is a part of the VSF 
                                   virtual chassis.
              shutdown (6)       - The member-switch is in the shut down state.
              booting (7)        - The member-switch is booting.
              communicationFailure (8)- The member-switch cannot be reached.
              incompatibleOS (9) - The member-switch is running with a different 
                                   Operating System.
              unknownState (10)  - The state of the member-switch cannot be determined.                                      
              standbyBooting (11)- The standby switch is currently booting up. When 
                                   the switch finishes booting, its state will change 
                                   to standby (4)."
